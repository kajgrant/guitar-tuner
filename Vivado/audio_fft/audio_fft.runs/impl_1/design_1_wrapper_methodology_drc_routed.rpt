There is a large setup violation of -6.246 ns between design_1_i/custom_hps_1/U0/custom_hps_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/slv_reg0_reg[27]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and design_1_i/custom_hps_1/U0/custom_hps_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/hps_0/temp_reg__0/PCIN[6] (clocked by clk_fpga_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
